# 2. Zustand for State Management

Date: 2022-11-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I need a state-management solution on this project.

TODO: Elaborate on context ()

## Decision

I will use Zustand: https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand

## Consequences

Pros

- Simplicity
- Scope
- Developer Experience
- Documentation is focused and pragmatic
- Not tied to React context
  - Not tied to use within a React app or React itself
  - Good for MFE Architecture
- You can use Redux devtools

Cons

- Documentation could be improved
- Can get clunky when complexity is introduced
